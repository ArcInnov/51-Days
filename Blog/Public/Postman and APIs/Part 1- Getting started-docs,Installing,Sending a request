# Getting Started- Offical docs, Installing Postman And Sending a Request

## Sunday July 17, 2022

Had a brief conversation with EKAGI who set me up with the task to use Postman to work with APIs.
HE emphasized that Postman will be a tool just like VSCode to say that we will be using Postman extensively will be an understatement.
I had very little clue to his question what are getrequests, parameters,headers etc.

A google search of the title 'how to use postman to work with Api' lands you to official documentation,

## Getting started > learning Centre

### Introduction

### Installing and Updating
Installing
 Installing postman for Windows
 There is web version installation of postman too but I am skipping over that section since I wasnt to focus on installing for th windows version for the moment
 After downnloading > Run exe file by double clicking > create account (opens browser) 
 Creating a free account with Postman (EKAGI said it is free for individuals and has paid plans for enterprises)
 
Updating

### Navigating Postman

 Environment selector and environment quick look
  The environment selector enables you to choose which environment to use in your work. Select an environment from the menu to set it as the active environment, which gives you access to the variables in that environment

1. Footer
 The footer on the bottom of Postman enables you to find and replace text, open the console, capture requests and cookies, open Bootcamp, and access several other tools

### Sending your first request
APIs provide a structured way for one application to access the capabilities of another application.
A client application (like a mobile app) sends a request to the server, and after the request processes the server returns a response to the client.
A request includes the URL of the API endpoint and an HTTP request method. The method indicates the action you want the API to perform. Here are some of the most common methods:
    GET retrieves data from an API.
    POST sends new data to an API.
    PATCH and PUT update existing data.
    DELETE removes existing data.

Sending a request
 Open new tab in workspace
 Give url
 Send request

What happened ?
 A get request was sent to an API server the server recieved, processed and returned a response the response was dislayed in response pane

Part 2 
Since I am a novice to postman (as novice as you can get) I think just following the Documentation page will be a slow slow learning curve so I am going to try a simple project using postman
