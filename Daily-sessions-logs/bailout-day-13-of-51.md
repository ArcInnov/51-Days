## Session 1 Notes
Conversation with EKAGI
1. Last 7 days update - why there was no progress?
    Got into the cycle where I do no work just procastinate

1. Task assigned 
    How to use Postman to work with APIs 
    Create a blog in 51-Days/Public blog about the same.

## Session 2 Notes
Update about progress with Respect to Postman

Why do we use API?
Explanation through an example:-
 Suppose you are making a chrome extension that gets activated on Linkedin profile pages
 The extension gets the skill (example python,javascript) mentioned by the user 
 Checks if there is a Github page mentioned if yes then opens the github profile gets actual lines of code of that skill and displays it in extension popup or current window.
 You would use a Github API to get the information about actual line of code of mentioned skill
Another Example:-
 Suppose you are making an chrome extension that displays the list and names of repositories of a user.
 You would have created an API end point where an id/ value would be given that would be given that would get you the names adn list of repositories of a user 

Why and where would you use Postman?
While you are writing code for application that requires the use of an API
You would (after reading documention) see how API responds to requests
Whether the code works as you would want it to work

### AI powered Chrome Extension
Let us divide the task of building the extension into smaller parts and create issues to mark those parts
Task - Create red border around the images on a webpage
Created #Issue 1 - Red Border on Images

Commit message "...." #1 Issue number - you will find something delightful
