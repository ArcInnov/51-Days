## TASK
three TODO's assigned
 1. Add 3 radio buttons
 1. Add id attribute to body of a html page
 1. Based on input from radio button change background color of html page

These tasks were based on Getting started chrome extensions 
I completly forgot what we had done and realised I understood very little of the work done in those extensions

##
Together resolved a major bug I was tryig to call document.Elemenid of a web page that wasn't linked to the html page that I needed
I needed the variable value but I made the variable name into a string.


## Questions
Will we able to run node.js code given in Cloud Vision API face detect tutorial?
No we will have to modify it


There will be some kind of API end point that we will be using to bypass node.js requirement
