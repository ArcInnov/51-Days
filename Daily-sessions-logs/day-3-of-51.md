### Personal realisations
It does not seem very imitadating as I listen in to the conversation as I find alot of things are not working simple things like connecting a iphone to mac throws up problem that need to be solved in real time by googling for solutions

Yup, this is what the day to day looks like. Lots of stupid blockers. But then non-stupid work that happens in between accumulates overtime and a cool thing gets built.

### Running notes for DJ session
Some bugs found and fixes
 

Issue raised by EKAGI's boss - Login issue
The same issue face by another colleague-

Export XYZ Database
Previously XYZ error - due to being in incorrect directory

Login Issue still not resolved --- EKAGI will have to change task
Issue only with Ipad not with Iphone
