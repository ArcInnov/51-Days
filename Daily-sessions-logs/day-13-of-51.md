## Running Notes Session 2
Live demo of Issue # 1 Thick red border

EKAGI's version of solving Issue #1
EKAGI made his version in 10 minutes
    Walk through of EKAGI's process of code
     Google queries 
     How his previous work with CSS and Queryselectors helped
     How he identified which links might be useful for him 
     Breaking task into even smaller parts
     Running javascript code from console itself
     Using selector on class and children of class

EKAGI's job search process for ARC
    Visited linkedin > TypeScript > Entrylevel
    Realised that even though entry level is mentioned companies in description are looking for 5-7 years of experience
    So changed parameter to Internships
    Checked out companies > found what they do > Narrowed the list
    Identified person responsible for hiting from people tab
    Identified person responsible for hiring and found their github page
    Applied red border on their profile photos using javascript console.
    Suggested reaching out to them and showing them something demoable

Task assiggned 
Look up a city you want to work from on github
Find a list of github profiles from there
Make a list of git hub profiles that you might want to reach out in sub section of Akhaet
Serves two puposes - you can test your exension on these profiles and you can reach out to them to get referrals.

Changed the scope of Chrome Extension (AI powered)
From Extension working on any page and all images to extension working only on profile photos of github users
(I prefer an extension that executes funcionality only when a image is clicked/selected manually)
