How to insert a breakpoint in VS code
To set a breakpoint in source code, click in the far left margin next to a line of code. You can also select the line and press F9, select Debug > Toggle Breakpoint, or right-click and select Breakpoint > Insert breakpoint. The breakpoint appears as a red dot in the left margin.

How do you run a line by line code in Visual Studio?
You can step through the code in a number of different methods, you can step through line by line using F11, step over using F10 or step out using (Shift+F11). Step Through: Each and every line of code executed will be debugged
