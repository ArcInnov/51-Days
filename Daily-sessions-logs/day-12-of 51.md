# Day 12 

## Running Notes
Repository
Default branch 
Rest work on their own branches
Then merge with main branch
To avoid conficting code
x commits ahead and y commits behind
    x commits ahead means EKAGI's has added x commits which the default branch does not have
    y commits behind means Work done by others merged with default branch
    after merging and pushing commit result x+1 commit on EKAGI

How to merge other's branch commits with your work
Command line
    git fetch -a   (Gets remote branches update)
    Reverting back to the point to avoid commiting changes he does not wish to be pushed
    Local devlopment 
    grep command
    git log command
    Best practice for writing commits (Task; Sunject-what commit does)
    if no conflict then automerge but if there is conflict  mauaaly reolve conglict
    Auto merge if no clash 
    If clash look up manuaaly

RESOLVING cONFLICTS
Different views available in VS code Look at changes in list form or nested form showing Folders and structure(tree view)
incoming change means change done by others
Saw advanced git merging


Concepts of package
API has a path and method
