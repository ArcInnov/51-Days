## Telephonic Conversation with EKAGI
Since EKAGI was busy with DJ we had a  telephonic conversation
EKAGI is happy with Arc's progress but he rightly poinnts out that Arc's speed is very slow,'

Why is the speed slow?
Because I constantly get stuck at problems and take long time solving them

Probable solutions when stuck - 
    Try to to think on paper
    At regular intervals take a break think about the problem you are solving
    Write the solutions tried briefly ideate other possible solutions or methods

EKAGI's view
You will keep becoming a beginner many times over your career 
As you grow in experience you will be able to see patterns and solve problems faster
Example :- An expereienced cricketer may face a different team or a new player but the rules of the game are largely same.

EKAGI's suggestion on how to network and increase chances of getting a interview.
 Start by shortlisting 5-10 companies (big/smalll/startups)
 Find their git hub active employees
 Contribut to their repositories, pull a issue
 Talk to them about your situation
 Ask them if they could refer you for a entry level position
 
EKAGI's suggestion to solve RYE's functionality
Try to look up chrome extension specific timer methods


## Note
Today I had to constantly remind myself its just day 11 because it was frustatiing and extremely challenging
