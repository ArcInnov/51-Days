## The 4 Columns Jobs Interview आखेट

ARC's and EKAGI's desired end state at the end of these 51 days is for ARC to land **a remote paid job, as an entry-level programmer**. 

So we will review the **The 4 Columns Jobs Interview आखेट** Google sheet every session: TODO link

Here is how this आखेट works:

TODO steps ... ARC to describe this.
Akhaet is a framework to find jobs and communicate without thinking too much and priortising action over thinking 


The framework really worked for EKAGi and helped him land many projects and jobs during his career
Ekagi says a lot of stuff written on job description is made up so focus on implementing Akhaet framework

### Dumb Running Notes

header row freeze
header height
yellow color .. not to bright .. not to dull .. had to do boring soul-sucking changes
percent should be percent .. no space
date format show me in more human friendly way .. day of week (text) .. month (text) .. then date (number)
google it .. 
new entry still requires manually selecting desired date format .. change in old cell does not
shorten day text .. month text .. throughtout column

## Structure of Sessions

1. EKAGI has DJ session's work already written down. Tabs open. Apps open. When ARC joins they jump right into DJ-ing. This forms 80% bulk of the session.
1. ARC will show what new commits were pushed to 51-Days repo.
1. ARC will describe his own "homework", ideally really small steps.
1. ARC will share latest status of `The आखेट` with EKAGI.

## Things Programmers Must Do Well

TODO .. ARC to expand on this later.
1. Research search 
1. COmmunicate with team
1. Write Actual code

## Akhat Rules
