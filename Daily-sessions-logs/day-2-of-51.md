## The 4 Columns Jobs Interview आखेट

ARC's and EKAGI's desired end state at the end of these 51 days is for ARC to land **a remote paid job, as an entry-level programmer**. 

So we will review the **The 4 Columns Jobs Interview आखेट** Google sheet every session: TODO link

Here is how this आखेट works:

TODO steps ... ARC to describe this.

### Dumb Running Notes

header row freeze
header height
yellow color .. not to bright .. not to dull .. had to do boring soul-sucking changes
percent should be percent .. no space
date format show me in more human friendly way .. day of week (text) .. month (text) .. then date (number)
google it .. 
new entry still requires manually selecting desired date format .. change in old cell does not
shorten day text .. month text .. throughtout column

## Structure of Sessions

1. EKAGI has DJ session's work already written down. Tabs open. Apps open. When ARC joins they jump right into DJ-ing. This forms 80% bulk of the session.
1. ARC will show what new commits were pushed to 51-Days repo
1. ARC will describe his own "homework"
1. ARC will share latest status of `The आखेट` with EKAGI

## Things Programmers Must Do Well

TODO .. ARC to expand on this later
