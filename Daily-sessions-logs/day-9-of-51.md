# Async Check-ins

Both EKAGI and ARC will share with each other what they will do over the next 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, and so on.
And then do check-ins every 30 minutes for 5 minutes or so.

## EKAGI's work

App Frontend talks to Backend API which talks to various 3rd Party tools. Users must be authenticated with tokens for communication. EKAGI's current task is to create a new endpoint on the Backend API, which when called, will talk to FEEDS 3rd party, and provision a user_id token.

EKAGI must set up latest working Backend API on local machine to build on top of that.

## ARC's Work

Larger goal- to build an extension that changes hair of people in photos to emma watson's hair
