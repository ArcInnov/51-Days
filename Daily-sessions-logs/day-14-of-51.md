## Notes of session with EKAGI
Short cut learned for comment in VS code ctrl+/

## Session 1
Discussed and decided #Issue 4

Intuitive and fun UI. Clear title and description for the extension.

On clicking extension icon show a popup that has Emma Watson's photo with a magic wand
Show some fun magic spell under the photo
Add button with clear call to action
On button click output github user id in an alert ... In a future issue this will be replaced by call to Google's AI face recognition API
Write up a helpful and clear title and description for the extension (We got to look good for the Chrome Web Store) ðŸ˜‡ ðŸ˜‰
TODO .... Replace this with a UI sample from EKAGI

Completed #Issue 3

## Session 2
EKAGI provided feedback on issue 3 code and suggested corrections and gave a hint 
Discussed and decided on #Issue 5

Place hairstyle wig in the general area of profile picture

Find a hairstyle wig-only png photo (no face, transparent background)
On extension button click create a new element on the page that holds the hairstyle wig-only photo
Use CSS styles to place this new element on top of profile picture
The wig need not perfectly align with the face ... we will do that part in a future issue after getting facial coordinates from Google Vision API
Later on maybe we will have many different wigs to rotate amongst ... might even include turbans, caps, hats?

## Session 3
Reviewed adding image functionality
It was throwing a error when loading from local storage
EKAGI suggested some Github resources
I could not still succesfully use the local source therfore used the url method to load images
