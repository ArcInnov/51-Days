# Day 5 of 51, Saturday 25 June

## On 24th June 2022
Making resume



## Running Notes
Greatest insight
1. build demonstratable project
1. For any project, infrastruce setup alone takes a hell lot of time (tools, IDE's, configurations, libraries, SDK's, server setup, downloads, errors during setup, etcetera). 

1. Infrastructure setup takes time
1. First project make chrome extension

# ARC EKAGI > Individual Attacks Next > Collaborate also, Compete also

Original thought was `pure apprenticeship`, where ARC follows EKAGI's DJ 
But we must hit purpose target in 51 Days
Pure DJ-ing will not help

In previous DJ sessions EKAGI did manual app releases.
Now he will automate them using Github Actions.
Which will require EGAKI to do CI/CD DevOps style work.

TODO .. Ekagi will create a codenamed github acc



# Blog / Public / Coding my first Chrome extension inspired by Emma Watson

ARC will write this, parallely, while building projects 0 and 1.

Just here in this repo, in `ROOT/Blog/Public/(appropriate-filename.md)`

Can be multiple small blog posts. Eg: [this 21 posts reactjs series](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-call-web-apis-with-the-useeffect-hook-in-react) and this TODO

But all connected to the larger blog post **Coding my first Chrome extension inspired by Emma Watson**

After ARC finishes projects 0 and 1 > THEY ARE FUCKING LIVE on the chrome extension store >  EKAGI will use them > Then as part of `project 2 of 5` ARC will make a coding-blog/portfolio site as well.


# Project 0 of 5

All code must be pushed to ARC's github.

Either this same REPO different folder. Or project's own separate repo.

EKAGI will see new commits every hour.

Arc will start here create one or two extensions exactly as google's own samples in his own repository except in ArcInnov's own repository
https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/

Google's own samples: https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples

Does not help end result-
Make this same extention if internet allows — BEST video tutorial on making a chrome extention: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n809nd4Zu4&t=284s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org 


# Project 1 of 5

All code must be pushed to ARC's github.

Either this same REPO different folder. Or project's own separate repo.

EKAGI will see new commits every hour.

This google chrome extenstion detects people on a webpage and makes them have as sexy hair as Emma Watson's.

ARC's description of how it will work.
A webpage has a lot of things apart from a person's photos like youtube video, ads etc

1. Identify photos of person on the webpage from numerous other data available on the webpage 
1. Identify the person face,hair ears
1. Identify the area of hair
1. Replace the hair of the person with Emma Watson's hair

## Questions

1. EKAGI has a script that breaks down a session in 5 minute intervals how does he do that

# Random points to go over
